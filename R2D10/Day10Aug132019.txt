Still working
on the technical documentation.
Still working on 
the User stories and validated the 
semantics. 
Currently doing some reading about
agile and scrum for product development.
My sister whose a 
programmer wanted me to learn 
how to use them for the development 
process. Went to 
https://www.collab.net/services/
training/agile_e-learning
I also read some differences of a
full-stack, front-end, and a back
end developer. So that I would 
be more familiarize with what track I should
take and learn to master some of the 
skills needed for each of those roles.
