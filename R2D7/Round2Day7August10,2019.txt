I Can't seem to figure out why a scroll bar is appearing in the footer when I resize it,
Was able to center the text in the product section
by applying float:none property. 
I also watched youtube videos about APIs and trying to figure out on how to 
use them. Also looked into a json crash course by traversy media.
I did some editing in the computation of the student excel automatic gradesheet 
I made.
