Still working on completing the 
tehcnical documentation
but also did a side project for making
CSS loaders. found a great free tutorial
from traversy media in youtube. 
Learned tha you can actually use "loremValue"
to generate automatic lorem ipsum text.
I also learned how to do a fade in effect using
javaScript.
