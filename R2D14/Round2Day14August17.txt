Things to do:
-Have plenty of work at school so doing some multitasking 
by watching and listening to a tutorial 
on how to make a tetris game with react js.

-Still working on the technical documentation project and found out 
that it was the simple ! that was causing me to fail the user story, 
Finally able to complete the semantics and user stories
requirements.

-Still working on understanding how APIs work. 
I'm also wondering about testing your
website in different browsers. So far I've only used chrome and
would like to be familiarize with the different browsers
from where you can test your website. 

-Doing some reading about the  
concrete definition of the difference between a website and a 
webapp.

-Trying to do some tweaks to one of my old project. Still
need to design a logo and adjust some of the colors plus some 
some parts such as the footer and the pop
up window I would still need to adjust some of the layout.
Wondering what does this security vulnerabilities mean in 
my dependencies going to need to read more about them. 

Planning to recreate this from scratch so that I could
remember and retain how I made it using SASS and use of the BEM 
methodology of naming classes.
