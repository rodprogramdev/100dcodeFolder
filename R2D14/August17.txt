Have plenty of work
at school so multitasking is by watching and listening to a tutorial 
on how to make a tetris game with react js.
Still working on the technical documentation project and found out that 
it was the simple ! that was causing me to fail the user story, also working on
understanding how APIs work. I'm also wondering about testing your
website in different browsers. So far I've only used chrome and
would like to be familiarize with the different browsers
from where you can test your website. Also looking for a 
concrete definition of the difference between a website and a 
webapp.
