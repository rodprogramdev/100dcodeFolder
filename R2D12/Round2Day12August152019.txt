August 15, 2019 Round2 Day 12

Progress: I've been playing around with animation of the 
technical documentation team. I also reviewed concepts of the 
BEM model, hoping to understand how I could further apply it 
to my projects. Looking into one of my previous project and
trying to find out how I can improve some of the glitches in the 
project.
