Progress:
Still working
on finding out about the issue of the
scroll bar coming out when 
I resize the page using
media querries. Playing around with the 
header section media querries and 
apply some breakpoints for different
screen sizes.
I also reviewed 
basic git commands to practice pushing
files into a remote repository
in github.
Also started the boiler plate html
files of the tech documentation 
project in FreeCodeCamp. 



@media(max-width:650px)
{
  nav{
	margin-top:10px;
	width: 100%;
	display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	align-items: center;
	text-align: center;
	padding: 0 50px;

  }
}

@media (max-width:660px)
nav > ul {
width: 90vw;
flex-direction:column;
align-items: center;

}
