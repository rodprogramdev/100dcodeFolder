Reviewed how to use bootstrap 4, found issues with extra white space, 
and found out that it's coming from the property top of my 
nav class. I've been playing around with the navbar and experiencing a 
lot of trial and error, trying to 
figure out how to fix it on the side for the user stories layout.
