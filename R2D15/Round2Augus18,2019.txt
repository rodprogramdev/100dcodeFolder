Progress:
Today I added some of the content of the JavaScript Technical
Documentation project I'm working on.

I did some tweaks with the old project card properties. Increased
the perspective from 20rem to 40rem to make the transition flip
of the card look more natural. Still need to think of a more suitable 
color with spiderman theme for the project colors. Comments would be 
highly appreciated.
