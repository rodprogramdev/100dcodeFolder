Day 8, 2019 
Progress: Worked on the alignment of the section features,
was able to fix and align the icons properly. I learned that you
can use a different flex-direction for media querries to re-arrange the 
nav ul elements into a column. Trying to find out how to arrange them into a center
position when resized.
