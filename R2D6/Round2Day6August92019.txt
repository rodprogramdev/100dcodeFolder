Progress: 
Currently worked on the footer section, was able to arrange the margin when resized and
applied media queries at max-width 600px. Also fixed the boxes into a column once 
resized. Trying to figure out how to place into the center the text inside of the cards.
I'm thinking about adding some more media querries for different screen sizes besides
max-width 800px and max-width 650px for more responsiveness option for different
screen devices.
